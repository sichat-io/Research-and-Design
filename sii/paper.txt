OYIS and Sichat: A Decentralized Solution to Digital Ownership and Control

Abstract

The digital age has created a need for individuals to have ownership and control over their digital assets. The principle of "Own Your ID and Server (OYIS)" is proposed as a means for individuals to achieve this autonomy. The principle requires individuals to own and control essential hardware and software resources, including computer, storage, network connection, identity and access management, and autonomous tools. This research presents a Sovereign Individual System (SIS) that implements OYIS as its first principle and demonstrates its usage in a decentralized chat application. An SIS consists of a pair of servers and clients that provide IAM and communication services to their owner and other authorized individuals. This paper discusses the design choices and implementation resources of SIS in the decentralized chat context, including the hardware architecture, software functions, and security measures. It also explores the potential benefits and challenges of SIS, including their implications for individual autonomy, privacy, security, and non-functional requirements of availability, reliability, and scalability. Overall, this paper contributes to the ongoing discussions on digital sovereignty and decentralized systems by proposing an OYIS-based system as a means for individuals to exercise their digital rights and freedoms in the digital age.

1. Introduction

The digital age has transformed the way people communicate, work, learn and socialize. More and more people and organizations live and do business in the digital world. In most online scenarios, an individual (a person or an organization) needs a digital identity and related authentication/access services. Even if an individual wants to keep anonymous in a transaction as a consumer, it is still necessary to authenticate the service provider. The NIST (Grassi et al., 2017) defines a digital identity (abbreviated as identity or ID hereafter) as "the unique representation of a subject engaged in an online transaction." In practice, an identity represents the information that uniquely identifies a specific individual in its social context. The digital age has exposed individuals to all kinds of identity-related risks and challenges such as privacy violations, data breaches, denial of services, and online censorship. To address these challenges, there are several Identity Access Management (IAM) models during its evolution from the early days of the Internet:

- Isolated: A service provider is also an identity provider. Most computer systems and intranet systems use this model.
- Centralized: this model uses PKI to separate some identity services such as certificate authorities (CAs). Most of today’s Internet service providers use the centralized model. It facilitates the authentication of service providers on the scale of the Internet.
- Federated: this model enables single sign-on by a trusted federation of a set of service providers and identity providers. The model lets a service provider delegate IAM functions to one or more big service providers. The benefit is that a user account can be used by multiple service providers.
- User-centric: users can choose an IAM provider using an open protocol such as OpenID Connect. But users have no or very limited control over their identities.
- Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): individuals own and control their identities. Two widely-used SSI applications are PGP and Bitcoin.

Each model has its niche in special application domains. All models may coexist in the long run. Nonetheless, there is a clear trend that in more and more scenarios, the creation/control of an identity is being shifted to its owner. There are two reasons behind the trend of the self identity model: IAM service providers by their nature are not trustworthy; sovereign individual identity becomes possible both technically and economically. Soltanl et. al (Soltanl et al., 2021) summarized the issues of IAM providers from multiple perspectives including data ownership and governance, fragmented identity data, data breaches and identity fraud. Furthermore, an uncomfortable fact is that the government of an IAM service provider has unlimited access to its identities by law. In practice, an individual cannot protect its identities if its IAM service is not fully controlled by the identity owner.

On the macro level, Davidson and Rees-Mogg in their book titled “The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age” (Davidson & Rees-Mogg, 1999) discussed many mega-political factors that sovereign individuals will replace nation-states when the world is shifting from an industrial to an information-based society. On the micro level, the advancements of cryptography (Boneh & Shoup, 2023) and mature open-source code libraries/applications allow an individual to have the same level of security guarantee in IAM as the most powerful government. The widely available cheap infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providers make it possible for an individual to own computer, storage and communication resources required for IAM functions with the desired service-level agreement in availability, reliability and scalability.

Most of today’s SSI systems (Soltanl et al., 2021) are based on blockchain technology that is an implementation detail that is not used in this research. The proposed Sovereign Individual System (SIS) is an autonomous Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. At the heart of SIS is the "Own Your ID and Server" (OYIS) principle: an individual can create and control its identities independtly and all the required resources including computer, storage and communication are at its disposal. It is a first principle because an individual cannot have autonomy and full-control if the use of its identity depends on anything not owned and controlled by the individual. The OYIS sets SIS apart from other decentralized systems, but it presents significant design challenges that must be addressed to ensure high availability, reliability, scalability, and ease of use. Furthermore, the broad applications of identity make it impossible to have a one-size-fits-all solution. This research designs the SIS system in the context of a specific application domain: an online chat application. The application is named as Sovereign Individual Chat (Sichat) to highlight the use of SIS.

This research paper provides a detailed analysis of Sichat's design and implementation, with a particular focus on the OYIS principle. We first explain why OYIS is necessary to enable individuals to become sovereign in the digital age and outline the essential hardware and software resources that individuals need to own and control. We then describe Sichat's architecture, including its decentralized P2P overlay networks, sovereign networks, and sovereign individual systems (SIS), and we examine how Sichat's design handles different hardware configurations and changes in a sovereign network. Overall, this paper offers a comprehensive overview of Sichat's design and implementation, highlighting the unique challenges of the OYIS principle.

How can individuals achieve sovereignty and control over their digital assets and interactions through an OYIS approach in decentralized systems such as Sichat, and what are the challenges and potential solutions for implementing this approach in practice? This research aims to explore the technical, economic, and social dimensions of OYIS in decentralized systems, and to propose strategies and recommendations for promoting user adoption and empowerment in the digital age. We hope that this paper will be a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and users interested in decentralized systems and contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to ensure privacy, ownership, and control in the digital age.

2. Motivation

In today's digital world, the pervasive issues of identity theft, data breaches, and privacy violations are increasingly rampant. Conventional identity systems rely on centralized authorities, such as governments or corporations, to verify and manage identities. However, such centralized systems may be vulnerable to attacks, data leaks, or abuse of power. Furthermore, these systems often curtail users' control over their data and may share or sell it without their consent.

To tackle these problems, a novel paradigm of user-owned identity has emerged, which empowers users to manage their identity information. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems, based on blockchain and other decentralized technologies, allow users to create and manage their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities or intermediaries.

The main aim of SSI systems is to provide privacy, security, and user control while enabling trustworthy interactions and transactions in the digital realm. However, most existing SSI systems still rely on blockchain, which may have limitations in terms of scalability, energy consumption, and accessibility. Therefore, alternative approaches to user-owned identity that do not rely on blockchain yet offer similar features and benefits are necessary.

In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to user-owned identity that does not depend on blockchain but still allows users to control their identity data, authenticate their credentials, and interact with others in a secure and trustworthy way. Our approach leverages existing standards and protocols and builds on the principles of SSI while offering a new architecture and implementation that can overcome some of the limitations of existing SSI systems.

3. Literature Review

Several scholars and practitioners have discussed identity, leading to the development of various principles and frameworks for understanding and managing it. One of the earliest sets of principles, proposed by Kim Cameron [1], emphasizes the importance of user control and privacy in identity systems. Other frameworks, such as the Respect Network policy [2]and the W3C Verifiable Claims Task Force FAQ [3], have also offered insights into digital identity.

One specific area of focus within the realm of identity is self-sovereign identity, which emphasizes the user's ownership and control over their own identity. Christopher Allen proposed ten principles [4] for self-sovereign identity, drawing on various perspectives on digital identity, including the aforementioned frameworks. Of these principles, two that are particularly relevant to self-sovereign identity are existence and control.

Existence refers to the user's independent existence as the basis for their identity. Allen notes that any self-sovereign identity must be based on the ineffable "I" that is at the heart of identity and that it cannot exist wholly in digital form. Instead, a self-sovereign identity simply makes public and accessible some limited aspects of the "I" that already exists. Control emphasizes the user's ultimate authority over their own identity. While the identity system may include algorithms that ensure the continued validity of an identity and its claims, the user should always be able to refer to it, update it, or even hide it. They must be able to choose privacy or publicity as they prefer. This does not mean that the user controls all the claims on their identity, as other users may make claims about them, but they should not be central to the identity itself.

These principles attempt to strike a balance between transparency, fairness, and support of the commons with protection for the individual, recognizing that identity can be used for both beneficial and malevolent purposes. By upholding the principles of existence and control, a self-sovereign identity can provide users with a more secure and trustworthy means of managing their identity in the digital realm.

In recent years, the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI) has gained significant attention as a means of providing individuals with greater control over their personal information. At the same time, many associate SSI with blockchain technology, but a growing body of literature suggests this is not necessarily true. One such article by Andreas [5] argues that decentralization, not blockchain, is the critical characteristic of SSI. Specifically, SSI refers to a system in which an individual's data is stored with the individual and is under their control. This is made possible through the use of cryptography, which allows for the creation of crucial pairs consisting of a public and private key. Digital signatures are then used to verify the authenticity of data transferred between issuers and holders of SSI. While blockchain technology can be used to store and query public keys in an SSI system, it is not the only option available.

As highlighted by Andreas, existing public key infrastructures (PKIs) can also be used, with the key consideration being the privacy of the holder and the need for a trust framework to ensure the authenticity of the data. In addition to that article, another relevant paper is from Clifford Neuman [6]. He discusses the challenges associated with maintaining consistency in large distributed systems, highlighting the importance of closure as a means of ensuring the reliability and security of the system. This concept is particularly relevant to SSI systems, which require a trust framework to ensure the authenticity of data transfers.

Overall, the literature suggests that while blockchain technology can be used in SSI systems, it is not a prerequisite. Rather, the critical characteristic of SSI is decentralization, which is achieved through the use of cryptography and the creation of critical pairs. As such, any storage location that ensures privacy and authenticity can be used for public keys, with the need for a trust framework being a critical consideration. Additionally, the concept of closure discussed by Neuman highlights the importance of ensuring reliability and security in large distributed systems such as SSI.

4. Own Your ID and Server (OYIS): What and Why

In the digital age, being a sovereign individual means possessing supreme power and autonomy over one's digital assets and social activities within a limited sphere. This requires independent ownership and full control over essential hardware and software resources. The Own Your ID and Server (OYIS) principle enables the users to achieve that. The principle encompasses two crucial components: hardware and software.

The hardware component includes essential physical equipment such as a computer, storage, and network connection. These resources must be highly available, reliable, scalable, economically feasible, and easy to use since an individual's digital life depends on them. While an individual can technically own and control these resources at home, most often they are leased from a cloud service provider. A cloud service provider's leased server and storage space can meet most of the requirements for highly available, reliable, and scalable resources. The term "Server" is used to represent the computer, storage, and network connections and highlights the importance of these requirements. It is important to note that a home computer or smartphone does not meet the criteria for a qualified server. A smartphone, for example, can be offline frequently and has limited expandability, making it not scalable in computation, storage, and bandwidth.

The software component of OYIS includes identity and access management (IAM) and communication. An identity is a basic requirement in most social interactions, and an independent and autonomous IAM system requires a sovereign individual's server to play all three roles of issuer, holder, and verifier. The IAM system should always work even when an individual is offline, and the identity data should be securely and reliably stored. Similarly, an individual should always be able to receive and store messages securely and reliably.

Without OYIS, an individual's hardware, such as a smartphone or PC, has limited availability, reliability, and scalability. The client is often offline, has a high probability of failure or data loss, and has limited capacity in computation, storage, and communication. Identity data and other important information must be stored in other safe places. This means that without OYIS, an individual must rely on a third party or occasionally lose identity and communication services. This is unacceptable in the digital age, where access to digital assets and social activities is crucial.

In conclusion, in the digital age, individuals must have full control over their digital assets and social activities within a limited sphere to maintain their autonomy and sovereignty. One way to achieve this is through the "Own Your ID and Server (OYIS)" principle, which requires individuals to independently own and fully control their essential hardware and software resources. As defined by Merriam-Webster, sovereign individuals possess supreme power and autonomy. To exercise sovereignty in the digital age, individuals must embrace the OYIS principle to maintain full control over their digital lives. This means owning and controlling essential hardware and software resources, including a qualified server for highly available, reliable, and scalable resources, and an independent and autonomous IAM system for secure and reliable identity and access management, and communication. Only then can an individual be a sovereign individual in the digital age, possessing supreme power and autonomy over their digital assets and social activities within a limited sphere.
