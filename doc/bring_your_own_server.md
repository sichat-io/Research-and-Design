# Bring Your Own Server (BYOS)

The ultimate goal of Sichat is letting everyone to own and control the neccessary digital assets as a sovereign individual in the digital age. What differentiate Sichat from other similar decentralized systems is its first principle of "Bring Your Own Server (BYOS)".

## Why BYOS?

Merriam-Webster defines [sovereign](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sovereign) as "possessed of supreme power; unlimited in extend; enjoying autonomy". To be a sovereign individual in the gitial age, a person should fully and independently own and control his/her digital assets and social activities within a limited sphere. As the first principle, an individual needs to own essential hardware and software resourcces to exist and live digitally. It is named as "Bring Your Own Server (BYOS)" to represent the following essentail hardware and software resources:

- Hardware: computer, storage, and network.
- Software: identity and access management (IAM) and communication.

The hardware resources include the basic physical equipments for computation, data storage and data communication. An individual should own and has full control of these resources. Technically, the equipments can be in one's own places, or more commonly, are leased from a cloud service provider. Because an individual's digital life depends on the hardware resources, these resources must be highly availabe, highly reliable, highly scalable, economically feasible, and easy to use. The term `Server` highlights these non-functional requirements. Today, a leased server and storage space from a cloud service provider fulfills most requirements. However, a home computer or a smart phone is not a server by the above definition. For example, a smart phone is not a qualified server though it combines computer, storage and newtwork components. A smart phone can be offline or turned off frequently. To make it worse, it could be lost forever. Due to its small size and limited expandablity, it is not scalable in computation, storage and bandwidth. However, due to its mobility and rich functions, it is the UI to the server operations.

BYOS is an necessity for both IAM and communication. An identity is a basic requirment in most social interactions. There are three basic roles in an IAM system to manage identity(ID) or the more general verifiable credentil(VC): issuer, holder, and verifier. An independent and autonomous IAM system requires a sovereign individual's server to play all three roles. The IAM system should alwasy work even when an individual is offline. The ID data requires secure and reliable storage.

Similarly, an individual should always be able to receive messages and store messages in a secure and reliable way.

Conversly, without BYOS, an individual either has to rely on a third party or occasionally lose identity and communication services. The individual is not a sovereign individual in both cases.
