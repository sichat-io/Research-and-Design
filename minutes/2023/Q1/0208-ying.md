# Literature Review

## 1 [Towards the classification of Self-Sovereign Identity properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04155)

The paper lists a set of desired properties of SSI:

1. Existence and Representation: Entities must have an independent existence. They should be able to create as many identities as required without the intervention of a third party.
2. Decentralization: SSI systems should not rely on any third-party centralized system.
3. Autonomy: Entities must have full autonomy over their identity data without relying on any third party.They should be capable of being responsible for managing all operations related to their identity and data (creating, storing, updating, sharing, removing).
4. Control: Entities must control their digital identities and the involved data fully (e.g., self-asserted claims or claims provided by third parties, identifiers, encryption keys). They should be able to control the usage/sharing of their identity data and delegating control to autonomous agents and/or guardians of their choice.
5. Privacy and Minimal Disclosure: Entities should be able to protect their privacy by utilizing selective disclosure and data minimization. They should be able to disclose the minimum amount of identity data required for any particular interaction.

Other important properties are security, recoverability, standard and cost.

For us, the existence, autonomy, security, recoverability, standard and cost are important properties. Additionally, the system must be reliable.

## 2 [Is FIDO2 passwordless authentication a hype or for real? A position paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07161)

It lists FIDO2 four advantages: no password, phishing protection, better UE, low cost (no password recovery).
Workforce id vs customer id. (sichat for individual). The cons are:

- Customers most likely prefer password-based authentication.
- SSO with mutli-factor password is more secure
- Additional authenticator (possibly password-based) for recovery.
- Hard to share
- Password with auto filling is easier.

## 3 [A Survey of Self-Sovereign Identity Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02003)

This paper is pretty comprehensive survey of SSI ecosystem.

### 3.1 Issues

- Data ownership and governance: limited control and visibility; vendor lock-in; **denial of access**; unahtorized analysis and data access, specifically, **centralized data repositories give government and authorities arbitrary access without the consent of the user**;
- Password-based authentication: not secure; too many (191 password on average);
- Fragemented Identity Data: many identity repositories; messy data; lack of standards;
- Data breaches and identity fraud: many incidents.

### 3.2 IAM

Identity is a logical representation of a physical presence of a person or thing. According to ITU, a digital identity is "a digital representation of the information known about a specific individual, group, or organization.‚Äù

In a broader sense, Cameron in "The laws of Identity" defines digital identity as "a set of claims made by one digital subject about itself or another digital subject". He introdced seven laws of identity including User control and consent, Minimum disclosure for a constrained use, Justifiable Parties, Directed Identity, Pluralism of Operators and Technologies, Human integration, and Consistent Experience Across Contexts.

Term definitions:

- `Subjects` are entities, such as people or things that are under consideration.
- An `object` is a passive entity that is being accessed by a subject.
- `Identitifers` are  labels given to subjects.
- `Attrributes` are name-value properties describing the characteristic of an entity.
- `Personal Identifiable Information (PII)` are attributes that can assist in the revealing or tracing of an individual's identity.
- A `claim` is a statement (an asseration of the truth) about an entity.
- A `credential` is a set of one or more claims made by the same entity.
- A `verifiable credentail` is a set of tamper-evident claims and metadata that cryptographically prove who issued it.

No name can achieve Zooko's triangle: secure, decentralized, and human meaningful.

An IAM is a triad of user, identity provider and service provider. A user represents a specific individual, group or organization. An identitiy providere manges a user's idnentity informaiton. A service provider provides services based on the information provided by either a user or an identity provider.

The operations of IAM include identification (claim an id), verification (asssociate ID with the entity), authentication (vereifying the ID) and authorization (grant access). Authentication factors are 1) something the entity knows (password); 2) something the entity possesses (phone or token card);  3) something the entity is (biometric); 4) contextual information such as time, location, behavioral patterns and the entity's social repuation.

IAM models:

- Isolated: service provider is also identity provider
- Centralized: separate identity provider such as PKI and CA.
- Federated: signle sign-on enabled by a trusted fedrattion of a set of sevice providers and identity provders.
- User-centric: user can choose identify provider. OAuth and OpenID.
- SSI
  - the origin of SSI is from the consitution of humanity: "citizenship should not produce a data model via identity administration that directly harms the ability of any person to participate in our free Society."
  - 10 principles: Existene, Control, Access, Transparency,etc.
  - Most are block chain based
  - challenges: standards, key management, consent, access, accountability and governance, etc.

### 3.3 SSI Architecture

- DID: a spec and implementatoins by DIF.
- VC: a spec. Actors: issuer, holder, verifier and verifable data registry.
- DPKI: PGP usability and key managment issues.
- Blockchain
- Verifiable Data registry
- Agent
- Identity Hubs: DIF
- Digital Wallet
